      <h2>Story of Kate Chapman</h2>
      <p>
        Kate Chapman, 44, used a variety of techniques to overcome her
        depression. Her depression story is an ongoing one. Sometimes she will
        slip into depressed moods when she forgets to take care of herself
        personally, whether that’s emotional or physical care. But when she uses
        massage therapy, aromatherapy and comfort foods, she steps away from the
        darkness and feels better. Chapman also spends her time doing more
        creative and artistic things, which limit her from falling into a dark
        place. “I have found that when I use external and internal medicines in
        conscious combination, my depression stays a thing of the past,” she
        said. Wendy Honeycutt Wendy Honeycutt started feeling depressed after
        her mother and brother died, and her 12-year-old son passed away.
        Instead of letting depression take her over, she found nutrients that
        could boost her mood, and with those nutrients, she started leading a
        better life, she said. But there was more to how she recovered. She also
        re-established her faith. “My spiritual walk with Jesus has played a
        huge role in my battle with depression and my faith also enables me to
        live free of depression,” she said.
