      <h2>Story of Jay Lowder</h2>
      <p>
        Jay Lowder overcame depression by finding God. He was 21 when everything
        went south. He was dumped, he lost his car and he found himself
        unemployed all at once. Things began to spiral out of control from
        there. Depression settled in and Lowder turned to the bottle as a source
        of escape. Things took a dark turn for Lowder. But with the help of his
        roommate, and religion, he overcome his struggle with depression. He was
        invited to an event hosted by a preacher, and it was there that he
        rediscovered his faith in God and religion. It has helped him grow his
        faith as an evangelist. Heâ€™s looking to spread that message now across
        the world.
