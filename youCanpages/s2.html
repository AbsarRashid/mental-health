      <h2>Story of Ingrid</h2>
      <p>
        There was a time when Ingrid couldn’t get out of bed. She didn’t feel
        inspired. Though many would say she is jovial and happy-go-lucky, there
        was a sudden change for her. She would just start crying in the middle
        of the day, and she didn’t know why: “I could feel that my hormones were
        taking me into a very dark place,” she said. She turned to yoga and
        exercise for help, but that did very little in aiding her: “I would
        leave class feeling depleted and still sad,” she said. So how did she
        overcome depression? She spoke with her nutritionist, who told her to
        start taking a natural supplement that helped her balance out her
        hormones and stray away from the darker emotions.
