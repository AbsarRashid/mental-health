      <h2>Story of Lenore Hirsch</h2>

      <p>
        Lenore Hirsch was 57 when she first felt depressed.When her husband
        discovered that his previously beaten brain tumor was back, her life
        took on a darker shade. She struggled to function after his surgery to
        remove the tumor and couldn’t handle the problems associated with aiding
        her husband while also living in a small place: “I found myself having
        fits of crying I couldn't stop,” she said. But how did Hirsch overcome
        that depression? By writing. Once her husband passed away, Hirsch
        focused her attention on writing and building her career, which allowed
        her work through the demons that hung on her shoulder.
