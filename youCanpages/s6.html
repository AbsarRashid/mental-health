      <h2>Story of Drew Farnsworth</h2>
      <p>
        Drew Farnsworth isn’t very open about his depression, or his attempt at
        suicide. When in college 14 years ago, Farnsworth almost died by
        suicide, But his roommate found him in time, and that’s where everything
        changed. He went to college, got a degree and now owns two businesses.
        He thanks his family and those around him for helping him rise above
        depression. “With the help of my family, many therapists, numerous
        pharmaceuticals, very good habits and a lot of time, I have been able to
        live a healthy and mostly happy life,” Farnsworth said.
