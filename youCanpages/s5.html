      <h2>Story of Kim Hardy</h2>
      <p>
        Kim Hardy’s depression started when she lost her business. It was hard
        losing something she started from the ground up, and it hit her hard.
        She struggled with depression. But as a wife and mother, “I had so much
        to live for,” Hardy said. So now, Hardy is looking to help others beat
        depression. She recommends that people focus on themselves, acknowledge
        their depression and understand what battle they’ll have to wage. Then
        create a plan to beat it and understand it may be a bit of struggle.
        Lastly, she advises people to re-evaluate where they are in their own
        minds and how they think things are going in their life. “Sometimes that
        was only 15 minutes to 45 minutes,” Hardy said. “Whatever time I had, I
        made me a priority. I discovered I loved this time I had to reflect,
        process and pamper myself. Today, I am a thankful woman.”
